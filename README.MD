An absolutely bare-minimum sdk, using zero dependencies, for consuming PythV2 prices generated by the Pyth Solana Receiver.

## USAGE

Take a Pyth Price Feed Account as an `UncheckedAccount`. Here is example of this type of account on mainnet: https://solana.fm/address/7UVimffxr9ow1uXYxsr4LHAcV58mLzhmwaeKvJ1pjLiE

```
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Some_Instruction<'info> {
    /// CHECK: You may also want to validate `owner = PYTH_PID`
    pub price_acc: UncheckedAccount<'info>,
}
```

Then simply borrow the data, minus the 8-byte Anchor discrminator:

```
let data = &ctx.accounts.price_acc.try_borrow_data()?[8..];
let price_v2 = PriceUpdateV2::get_price_update_v2_from_bytes(data);

let price = price_v2.get_price_no_older_than(
    &Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp,
    MAXIMUM_AGE, // in seconds
    None, // Pass the feed ID in bytes if you want to validate it
)?;
```

Or if you absolutely do not care about any verification whatsoever:

```
price_v2.get_price_unchecked(None)
```

We suggest you validate the discriminator (see `DISCRIMINATOR_AS_HEX`) unless you are absolutely sure this is the correct account!
